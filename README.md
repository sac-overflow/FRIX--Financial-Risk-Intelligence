# FRIX - Financial Risk Intelligence & Fraud Detection Platform

FRIX is an AI-powered fintech risk intelligence platform designed to detect suspicious financial transactions, identify mule account behavior, analyze fraud networks using graph intelligence, and explain fraud decisions using an LLM-powered assistant.

## Problem Statement

Digital payment systems process millions of transactions every day. Fraudsters often use mule accounts, transaction chains, abnormal transfer patterns, and coordinated fraud rings to hide suspicious activity. Traditional rule-based fraud systems can miss evolving fraud patterns or create too many false positives.

FRIX aims to solve this by combining:
- Classical machine learning for fraud scoring
- Graph analytics for mule and fraud-ring detection
- LLM/RAG-based explanations for analyst decision support
- REST APIs for real-time and batch transaction scoring
- A dashboard for fraud monitoring and alert review

## Core Features

- Transaction fraud scoring
- Imbalanced fraud classification
- Graph-based mule account detection
- Suspicious account network analysis
- LLM-powered fraud explanation assistant
- Spring Boot backend APIs
- React dashboard
- PostgreSQL storage
- Model monitoring and future MLOps support
